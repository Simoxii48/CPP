C# Methods
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

C# is a fully OOP language , you cannot create a method outside class.

Create a Method
A method is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). 
C# provides some pre-defined methods, which you already are familiar with, such as Main(), 
but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:

Example:

 static void MyMethod() 
  {
    // code to be executed
  }


You should use static if you want to call the method without having obejct.
