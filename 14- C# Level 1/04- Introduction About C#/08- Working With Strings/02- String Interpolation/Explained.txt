String Interpolation

String interpolation is a better way of concatenating strings. We use + sign to concatenate 
string variables with static strings.

C# 6 includes a special character $ to identify an interpolated string. An interpolated string 
is a mixture of static string and string variable where string variables should be in {} brackets.
