Nullable Types

As you know, a value type cannot be assigned a null value. For example, 
int i = null will give you a compile time error.

C# 2.0 introduced nullable types that allow you to assign null to value type variables. 
You can declare nullable types using Nullable<t> where T is a type.

Nullable <int> i = null; //
int? i = null;		 // Same Syntax both


Nullable types are useful in scenarios where a value might not be available.

example, Nullable<int> can be assigned any value from -2147483648 to 2147483647, or a null value.
