    Code Overview

1. Header Files and Namespace:
    <iostream> is included for input and output operations.
    <string> is included for potential future use (not used in this program).
    <cmath> is included to use pow() for exponentiation (A²).
    using namespace std; allows the use of standard functions without prefixing them with std::.

2. User Input Function (ReadSquareSide)
    Prompts the user to enter the side length (A) of a square.
    Reads and returns the side length.

3. Area Calculation Function (CircleAreaInscribedInSquare)
    Takes the side length (A) as input.
    Uses the formula for the area of an inscribed circle in a square:
    
    
    This is implemented as:
    float Area = (PI * pow(A, 2)) / 4;
    
    pow(A, 2) calculates A².
    PI is defined as 3.141592653589793238 for precise calculations.
    The division by 4 ensures correct computation of the inscribed circle's area.
    Returns the computed area.
    
4. Output Function (PrintResult)
    Receives the computed area as a parameter.
    Prints "Circle Area = [Area]".
    
5. Program Execution (main())
    Calls ReadSquareSide() to get user input.
    Calls CircleAreaInscribedInSquare() to compute the inscribed circle's area.
    Calls PrintResult() to display the result.
    Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
    This structured explanation ensures clarity and ease of understanding.
