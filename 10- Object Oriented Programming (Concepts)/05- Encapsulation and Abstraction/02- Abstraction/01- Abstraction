Abstraction is a concept in computer science and programming where you hide complex details and show only the essential features of an object or process. It simplifies things by focusing on what is important and hiding unnecessary information. For example, when using a smartphone, you don't need to know how the hardware worksâ€”just how to use the apps and functions.

Simply is making others life easier when accessing the object, they only find what they need to use.
