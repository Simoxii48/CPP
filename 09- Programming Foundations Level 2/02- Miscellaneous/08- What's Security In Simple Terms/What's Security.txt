Security, in simple terms, is the practice of protecting something valuable from harm, theft, or unauthorized access. It involves taking steps to ensure that people, information, or assets are safe and secure from dangers like attacks, fraud, or damage.

For example:

Personal security could mean locking your doors to keep intruders out.
Digital security could mean using passwords to protect your online accounts from hackers.
In essence, security is about keeping things safe and preventing unwanted risks or threats.
