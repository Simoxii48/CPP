XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a flexible, text-based format used to store and transport data. Unlike JSON, XML allows users to define their own tags, making it customizable for different kinds of data. It's designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable.

Key Characteristics:
Tags: Like HTML, XML uses tags to mark the beginning and end of elements.
Nested structure: XML data is hierarchical, with elements that can contain other elements.
Self-descriptive: The tags describe the data, making it easier to understand.
Example of XML:

<person>
  <name>John</name>
  <age>30</age>
  <isStudent>false</isStudent>
  <courses>
    <course>Math</course>
    <course>Science</course>
  </courses>
  <address>
    <street>123 Main St</street>
    <city>New York</city>
  </address>
</person>

Key Points:
Tags (like <name> or <age>) define the data.
Attributes can be added to tags to give extra information (e.g., <course type="required">Math</course>).
XML is widely used for data exchange between different systems, particularly in legacy applications, web services, and configurations.
While JSON is now more commonly used in modern applications due to its simplicity, XML still has a strong presence, especially in areas like document storage, configurations, and older web services.
